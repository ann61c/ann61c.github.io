                Well, it’s clear that the committee has agreed that your new policy is really excellent plan, but in
                view of some of the doubts being expressed, may I propose that I recall that , after careful
                consideration, the considered view of the committee was, while they considered that the proposal met
                with broad approval in principle, that some of the principles were sufficiently fundamental in
                principle, and some of the considerations so complex and finely balanced in practice that, in principle,
                it was proposed that the sensible and prudent practice would be to submit the proposal for more detailed
                consideration, laying stressing on the essential continuity of the new proposal with existing
                principles, and the principle of the principal arguments which the proposal proposes and propounds for
                their approval in principle.

            <p>
                Notwithstanding the fact that your proposal could conceivably encompass certain concomitant benefits of
                a marginal and peripheral relevance, there is a countervailing consideration of infinitely superior
                magnitude, involving your personal complicity and corroborative malfeasance, with the consequence that
                the taint and stigma of your former associations and diversions could irredeemably and irretrievably
                invalidate your position and culminate in public revelations and recriminations of a profoundly
                embarrassing and ultimately indefensible character.

            <p>
                Ah, when I say “not overstretched”, I was of course talking in the sense of total, cumulative loading
                taken globally, rather than in respect of certain individual and essentially anomalous responsibilities,
                which are not, logically speaking, consonant or harmonious with the broad spectrum of intermeshing and
                inseparable functions and could indeed be said to place an excessive and supererogatory burden on the
                office when considered in relation to the comparatively exiguous advantages of their overall
                centralization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prime minister, I must protest in the strongest possible terms my profound opposition to a newly
                instituted practice which imposes severe and intolerable restrictions upon the ingress and egress of
                senior members of the hierarchy which will, in all probability, should the current deplorable innovation
                be perpetuated, precipitate a constriction on the channels of communication and culminate in the
                condition of organizational atrophy and administrative paralysis which will render effectively
                impossible the coherent and coordinated discharge function of the government within, Her Majesty, United
                Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

                It is characteristic of all committee discussed decisions that every member has a vivid recollection of
                them and that every member’s recollection of them differs violently from every other member’s
                recollection. Consequently, we accept the convention that official decisions are those and only those
                which have been officially recorded in the minutes by the officials. From which it emerges, with an
                elegant inevitability, that any decision which have officially been reached will have been officially
                recorded in the minutes by the officials, and any decision which has not been recorded in the minutes
                has not officially reached, even if one or more members believe they can recollect it, so, in this
                particular case, if the decision had been officially reached, it would have been officially recorded in
                the minutes by the officials. And it isn’t, so it wasn’t.

            <p>
                Prime Minster, I’ve had another word with her. To put it simply, Prime Minister, certain informal
                discussions took place involving a full and frank exchange of views, out of which there arose a series
                of proposals which, on examination, proved to indicate certain promising lines of inquiry, which, when
                pursued, led to the realization that the alternative courses of action might, in fact, in certain
                circumstances, be susceptible of discreet modification, leading to a reappraisal of the original areas
                of difference and pointing the way to encouraging possibilities of compromise and cooperation, which, if
                bilaterally implemented with appropriate give and take on both sides, might, if climate were right, have
                a reasonable possibility, at the end of the day, of leading, rightly or wrongly, to a mutually
                satisfactory resolution.

                I mean they will give it most serious urgent consideration and insist on a thorough and rigorous
                examination of the all proposals allied to a detailed feasibility study and budget analysis, before
                producing a consultive document for consideration by all interested bodies and seeking comments and
                recommendations to be included in a brief for a series of working parties who will produce individual
                studies which will provide the background for a more wide-ranging document considering whether or not
                the proposal should be taken forward to the next stage.

                Yes, unfortunately, although the answer was indeed clear, simple and straightforward, there is some
                difficult in justifiably assigning the fourth term you applied to the statement in as much as the
                precise correlation between the information you communicated and facts insofar as they can be determined
                and demonstrated is such as to cause epistemological problems of sufficient magnitude as to lay upon the
                logical and semantic resources of the English language a heavier burden than they can reasonably be
                expected to bear.

            <p>So whereas there must inevitably be some element of shared responsibility for the governance of Britain,
                as between the legislators on the one hand and the administration on the other, the precise allocation
                of cause to consequence or agency to eventuality in any particular instance is invariably so complex as
                to be ultimately invalid if not irresponsible.</p>

                Yes, of course. Unemployment is a single name applied by the media to what is a wide range of
                socio-economic phenomena whose most politically visible manifestation happens to be … a current
                frequency of weekly registrations on the National Unemployment Register which is deemed to be above what
                has throughoutly been held ought be an acceptable level, but even separating out the component causes,
                let alone allocating responsibility for them, is a task of such analytical delicacy as not to be
                susceptible of compression within the narrow confines of a popular radio program.

                Sir Humphrey: "I wonder if I might crave your momentary indulgence in order to discharge a by no means
                disagreeable obligation which has, over the years, become more or less established practice in
                government service as we approach the terminal period of the year — calendar, of course, not financial —
                in fact, not to put too fine a point on it, Week Fifty-One — and submit to you, with all appropriate
                deference, for your consideration at a convenient juncture, a sincere and sanguine expectation — indeed
                confidence — indeed one might go so far as to say hope — that the aforementioned period may be, at the
                end of the day, when all relevant factors have been taken into consideration, susceptible to being
                deemed to be such as to merit a final verdict of having been by no means unsatisfactory in its overall
                outcome and, in the final analysis, to give grounds for being judged, on mature reflection, to have been
                conducive to generating a degree of gratification which will be seen in retrospect to have been
                significantly higher than the general average."

                Jim Hacker: "Are you trying to say "Happy Christmas," Humphrey?"

            <p>
                Well briefly, sir, I am the Permanent Under Secretary of State, known as the Permanent Secretary.
                Woolley here is your Principal Private Secretary. I too have a Principal Private Secretary and he is the
                Principal Private Secretary to the Permanent Secretary. Directly responsible to me are ten Deputy
                Secretaries, 87 Under Secretaries and 219 Assistant Secretaries. Directly responsible to the Principal
                Private Secretaries are plain Private Secretaries, and the Prime Minister will be appointing two
                Parliamentary Under-Secretaries and you will be appointing your own Parliamentary Private Secretary.
            </p>
            <h2><a id="S01E06">S01E06 The right to know</a></h2>
            <p>
                The Minister has three fonctions. First, as an advocate, making the Department's actions seem plausible
                to Parliament and public. In fact, he is our public relation's man. Second, he is our man in
                Westminster, steering our legislation through Parliament. And third, he is our bread winner. He has to
                fight in Cabinet for the money we need to run our Department. But he is not here to review departmental
                procedures with Principals and Assistant Secretaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you ask me for a straight answer then I shall say that, as far as we can see, looking at it by and
                large, taking one time with another, in terms of the average of departments, then in the final analysis
                it is probably true to say that at the end of the day, in general terms, you would probably find that
                not to put too fine a point on it, there probably wasn't very much in it one way or the other. As far as
                one can see at this stage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Minister, the traditional allocation of executive responsabilities has always been so determined as to
                liberate the ministerial incumbent from the administrative minutiae by devolving the managerial
                functions to those whose experience and qualifications have better formed them for the performance of
                such humble
                offices, thereby releasing their political overlords for the more onerous duties and profound
                deliberations which are the
                inevitable concomitant of their exalted position.

            <p>
                Well, it was a conversation to the effect that in view of the somewhat nebulous and inexplicit nature of
                your remit and the arguably marginal and peripheral nature of your influence on the central
                deliberations and decisions within the political process, that there could be a case for restructuring
                their action priorities in such a way as to eliminate your liquidation from their immediate agenda.
                (They said that?) That was the gist of it.
            </p>
            <h2><a id="S03E03">S03E03 The skeleton in the cupboard</a></h2>
            <p>
                The identity of the Official whose alleged responsibility for this hypothetical oversight has been the
                subject of recent discussion, is not shrouded in quite such impenetrable obscurity, as certain previous
                disclosures (revelations) may have led you to assume, but not to put too fine a point on it, the
                individual in question is, it may surprise you to learn, one whom you present interlocutor is in the
                habit of defining by means of the perpendicular pronoun.

                Well of course, if it were a statutory instrument, it would indeed have to be laid on the table of the
                House, but it is an administrative order made under Section 7, Subsection 3 of the Environment
                Administration Act, which is an enabling section, empowering the Minister to make such regulations
                regarding unused local authority land as might be necessary from time to time within the general frame
                work of the Act, as I'm sure you recollect only too clearly.

            <h2><a id="S03E08">S03E08 Party games</a></h2>
            <p>
                Sir just one thing: I wonder if I might crave your momentary indulgence in order to discharge a by no
                means disagreeable obligation which has, over the years, become a more or less established practice in
                the the government circles as we approach the terminal period of the year - calendar of course not
                financial, in fact, not to put too fine a point on it, Week Fifty-One and submit to you, with all
                appropriate deference, for your consideration at a convenient juncture, a sincere and sanguine
                expectation, indeed confidence - indeed one might go so far as to say hope - that the aforementioned
                period may be at the end of the day, when all relevant factors have been taken into considerations,
                susceptible to being deemed to be such as to merit a final verdict of having been by no means
                unsatisfactory in its overall outcome and in the final analysis to give grounds for being judged on
                mature reflection to have been conducive to generating a degree of gratification which will be seen in
                retrospect to have been significantly higher than the general average.
            </p>
            <p>
                The relationship which I might tentatively venture to aver (declare/assert) has been not without some
                degree of reciprocal utility and perhaps even occasional gratification,
                is emerging a point of irreversible bifurcation and, to be brief, is in the propinquity (proximity) of
                its ultimate regrettable termination.
